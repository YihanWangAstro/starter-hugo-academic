I am currently a fellow of the Nevada Center for Astrophysics (NCfA) based at UNLV. I primarily collaborate with [Bing Zhang](https://www.physics.unlv.edu/~bzhang/) and [Zhaohuan Zhu](https://www.physics.unlv.edu/~zhzhu/Home.html). Prior to my role at UNLV, I pursued my PhD at Stony Brook University under [Rosalba Perna](https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/rosalba/). I am a dynamicist interested in a diverse range of topics, including exoplanets, black hole mergers, tidal disruption events, and gamma-ray bursts. In addition to my research pursuits, I have a keen interest in astrophysics software development.
