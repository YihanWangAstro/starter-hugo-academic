I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working with [Nick Stone](https://www.ncstone.space). Previously, I was a Fellow at the Nevada Center for Astrophysics at UNLV, collaborating with [Bing Zhang](https://www.physics.unlv.edu/~bzhang/) and [Zhaohuan Zhu](https://www.physics.unlv.edu/~zhzhu/Home.html). I completed my PhD at Stony Brook University under [Rosalba Perna](https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/rosalba/).

My research establishes a unified framework for understanding the coupled evolution of AGN disks and their embedded stellar populations. This paradigm connects a broad class of phenomena: rapid AGN state transitions, the puzzling demographics of tidal disruption events, quasi-periodic eruptions, and the formation of gravitational wave sources detectable by LIGO and LISA. I develop open-source simulation tools including [SpaceHub](https://yihanwangastro.github.io/SpaceHubWeb/) for few-body dynamics and [VegasAfterglow](https://github.com/YihanWangAstro/VegasAfterglow) for gamma-ray burst afterglow modeling.
