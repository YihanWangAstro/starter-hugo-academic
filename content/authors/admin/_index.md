I am a postdoc fellow of NCfA (Nevada Center for Astrophysics) at UNLV (Independent, but work mostly with [Bing Zhang](https://www.physics.unlv.edu/~bzhang/) and [Zhaohuan Zhu](https://www.physics.unlv.edu/~zhzhu/Home.html)). Before I came to UNLV, I was a PhD student of Stony Brook University working with [Rosalba Perna](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/rosalba/). My research interests include tidal disruption events by solar mass black holes, gamma-ray bursts in dense environment, few-body dynamics with applications from supermassive black hole dynamics in galactic centers, to binary compact object mergers in AGN disks, to exoplanetary dynamics in dense star clusters. I am also a hardcore astrophysics software developer.
