I am currently a postdoc fellow at the Nevada Center for Astrophysics (NCfA) based at UNLV. I primarily collaborate with [Bing Zhang](https://www.physics.unlv.edu/~bzhang/) and [Zhaohuan Zhu](https://www.physics.unlv.edu/~zhzhu/Home.html). Prior to my role at UNLV, I pursued my PhD at Stony Brook University under the guidance of [Rosalba Perna](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/rosalba/). My research interests span a diverse range of phenomena including tidal disruption events, gamma-ray bursts, and few-body dynamics, with applications that extend from exoplanets to stellar mass black holes, and further to supermassive black holes. In addition to my research pursuits, I am also a dedicated astrophysics software developer.
