# Jupiter Mass Binary Object (JuMBO) formation from stellar flybys

This work has been motivated by the very recent report of observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of candidate Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (a.k.a JuMBO), whose existence does not readily fits in any current planetary formation theory. More specifically, via dedicated N-body simulations, we set to investigate the possibility that a close flyby can result in the ejection of two planets in outer orbits, which remain bound to one another. The mass ratio between the star and planet in the scattering experiments is set to be 1e-3.
