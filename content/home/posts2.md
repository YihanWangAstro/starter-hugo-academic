## Galactic Center Black Hole Merger

Our Milky Way's central black hole, Sagittarius A*, shows a peculiar spin orientation misaligned with the Galactic plane. We proposed that this misalignment is evidence of a past merger with another massive black hole roughly 9 billion years ago. This work provides a new window into the assembly history of supermassive black holes.

## Stellar Dynamics in AGN Disks

Star-disk coupling in Active Galactic Nuclei fundamentally reshapes nuclear cluster evolution. Objects on retrograde, high-inclination orbits experience eccentricity excitation as their vertical motion is damped. Once flattened, eccentricity is suppressed, leading to prograde, near-circular disk orbits. This process breaks steady-state assumptions and has wide-reaching consequences for tidal disruption events, changing-look AGN, and gravitational wave sources.

## Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs)

JWST discovered Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects in the Orion Nebula—pairs of planetary-mass objects orbiting each other while floating freely in space. Using N-body simulations, we showed that close stellar flybys can eject two planets that remain gravitationally bound.
