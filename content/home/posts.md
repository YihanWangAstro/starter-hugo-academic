## Drawing
Aside from my scientific endeavors, I have a deep appreciation for the art and architecture of my hometown, Chongqing, known for its ancient Chinese-style buildings nestled in the mountainous terrain of southwest China. This passion, particularly evident in my sketches of iconic locales like 'HongYa Dong', stems from a childhood surrounded by the city's rich cultural background.  ![image](uploads/drawing.png)


## Skiing
During my second year of Ph.D. studies, I tried skiing for the first time. Despite a bumpy start that led to a quick meeting with the first-aid patrol, I found myself hooked. It was a surprising but welcomed discovery, offering a hobby that was just challenging and rewarding. 

As time went on, skiing became more than just a pastime. It turned into a regular activity where I could see and feel myself getting better, one ski trip at a time. The sense of progress and the fun of speeding down the slopes kept pulling me back.

Even though I started skiing in the US, I became quite interested in the approach of the Canadian Ski Instructors' Alliance (CSIA) in Canada. Their focus on constant growth and skill development really clicked with me, mirroring my own experiences and enjoyment in the sport.

Now, I'm working slowly towards meeting the Level III certification standard from CSIA, a goal that highlights the commitment and enjoyment I've found in skiing over the years.

In the following video, I’ve captured one of my ski seasons with my mates before the pandemic struck. It was a time of camaraderie, laughter, and the simple joy of cruising down the slopes with friends. You can spot me easily – I'm the guy sporting the unmistakably yellow pants.
