## Drawing

I grew up in Chongqing, a city known for its dramatic mountainous terrain and traditional Chinese architecture in southwest China. I enjoy sketching the city's iconic sites like Hongya Dong, which reflects both its cultural heritage and its striking urban landscape.

## Skiing

I picked up skiing during my PhD and quickly got hooked despite an early encounter with ski patrol. What started as a new challenge became a regular pursuit where steady improvement kept me coming back.

I've been training toward CSIA Level III certification, drawn to their systematic approach to skill development. Below is a clip from a pre-pandemic ski season with friends. I'm the one in the yellow pants.
