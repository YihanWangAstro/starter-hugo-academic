  caption: Relative energy error and performance tests on a two body system with extreme
    eccentricity e=0.9999 and semi-major axis a = 1 AU. The central object has a mass
    of 1 solar mass and the test particle has a mass of 1 earth mass. We integrate
    the system for 1000 orbits. This test is designed to quantify how the different
    integration methods are able to handle extremely eccentric orbits and very close
    pair-wise approaches between particles.
